 * The room booking API, version 0.

 * <p>This javadoc is the written contract. Callers outside this module (the
 * front desk app in {@code consumer/}, for one) are entitled to everything
 * stated here and to nothing else. If a change would make any sentence below
 * false for an existing caller, it is a breaking change no matter how the code
 * is shaped.
 *
 * <p>Vocabulary used throughout: a room's schedule is a set of bookings, each
 * covering the half-open minute range {@code [startMinute, endMinute)}. Two
 * ranges conflict when they overlap, so a booking ending at minute 600 and one
 * starting at minute 600 do not conflict. Minutes are counted from midnight on
 * the booking day.

    /**
     * Books a room for the request's half-open range
     * {@code [startMinute, endMinute)}.
     *
     * <p>If no CONFIRMED booking on that room overlaps the range, the returned
     * booking is CONFIRMED and holds the room.
     *
     * <p>If some CONFIRMED booking does overlap, what happens next is decided
     * by the request's {@code waitlistKey}:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code waitlistKey} null means do not waitlist on conflict. No
     *       booking is created and the method returns null. Nothing about the
     *       room's schedule changes.</li>
     *   <li>{@code waitlistKey} non-null means waitlist on conflict. A booking
     *       is created with status WAITLISTED, carrying the key, and returned.
     *       It does not hold the room. It becomes CONFIRMED only if it is later
     *       promoted, which happens when a conflicting booking is cancelled
     *       with notification (see
     *       {@link #cancelBooking(long, boolean)}).</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The key itself is an opaque caller-supplied string. This API stores it
     * and hands it back on {@link Booking#getWaitlistKey()}; it never
     * interprets it. The key has no effect when there is no conflict: the
     * booking is CONFIRMED and the key is simply retained.
     *
     * <p>Notes are likewise an opaque caller-supplied string, stored and handed
     * back on {@link Booking#getNotes()}. They have no effect on conflicts,
     * waitlisting, or promotion.
     *
     * <p>Ids are assigned by the implementation, are unique, and increase in
     * creation order.

     * @param request the booking to make, non-null; its room id must be
     *                non-null and its end minute must be greater than its

     * @return the CONFIRMED booking, the WAITLISTED booking, or null when the
     *         range conflicts and no waitlist key was given
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code request} or its room id is
